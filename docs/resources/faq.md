## Exercise-Specific Questions

### Q: My generated data looks different from the examples
**A:** This is normal! Random data generation creates different results each time. Use `np.random.seed()` for reproducible results.

### Q: How do I know if my classes are separable?
**A:** Look for:
- Clear visual separation in scatter plots
- Minimal or no overlap between class regions
- Ability to draw a straight line separating classes

### Q: What if I can't complete all the questions?
**A:** Focus on understanding the concepts. You can:
- Skip challenging questions initially
- Return to them after completing other parts
- Ask for help on GitHub Issues

## Course Structure Questions

### Q: Do I need to complete exercises in order?
**A:** Yes, exercises build upon each other. Complete them sequentially for the best learning experience.

### Q: Are there solutions available?
**A:** Solutions are embedded in the notebook exercises. Work through the problems first, then check the provided solutions.

### Q: Can I modify the exercise code?
**A:** Absolutely! Experimentation is encouraged. Try:
