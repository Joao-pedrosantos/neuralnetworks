# About This Course

## Course Information

**Neural Networks** is an interactive course designed to provide hands-on experience with neural network theory and implementation. Through practical Jupyter notebook exercises, students explore fundamental concepts from basic data generation to advanced optimization techniques.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into three progressive exercises:

1. **Foundations**: Data generation and visualization
2. **Implementation**: Building neural networks from scratch  
3. **Advanced Topics**: Modern techniques and optimization

## Learning Philosophy

This course emphasizes:

- **Learning by Doing**: All concepts are reinforced through practical implementation
- **Mathematical Understanding**: Deep dive into the mathematical foundations
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each exercise builds upon previous knowledge
- **Interactive Exploration**: Jupyter notebooks enable experimentation and visualization

## Technical Requirements

### Software Dependencies
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Additional libraries as specified in each exercise

### Hardware Requirements
- Standard laptop/desktop computer
- No GPU required (though beneficial for larger experiments)
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
