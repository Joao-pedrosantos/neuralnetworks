# Projects

This section contains hands-on exercises designed to reinforce theoretical concepts through practical implementation. Each exercise builds upon previous knowledge and introduces new concepts progressively.

## Exercise Structure

All exercises are provided as interactive Jupyter notebooks with:

- üìù **Detailed explanations** of concepts and methodology
- üíª **Starter code** with clear instructions
- üìä **Visualizations** to understand data and results
- ‚ùì **Questions** to test your understanding
- üéØ **Challenges** for deeper exploration

## Available Projects

### Project 2: MLP Implementation

This foundational exercise implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to estimate calories burnt during exercise based on physical and activity parameters.

!!! info "Exercise Components"
    **Part A**: Data preprocessing and MLP architecture design  
    **Part B**: Training and validation of the calorie prediction model  
    **Part C**: Performance evaluation and parameter optimization  

**Skills you'll develop:**
- MLP implementation from scratch
- Regression modeling with neural networks  
- Feature engineering for fitness data
- Statistical analysis of class distributions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joao-pedrosantos/neuralnetworks.git
   cd neuralnetworks
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

4. **Open any exercise notebook** and start learning!

## Tips for Success

!!! tip "Best Practices"
    - **Read thoroughly**: Don't skip the explanatory text in notebooks
    - **Experiment**: Try modifying parameters and observe results
    - **Visualize**: Use plots to understand what's happening with your data
    - **Document**: Add your own notes and observations
    - **Practice**: Complete all questions and challenges

!!! warning "Common Pitfalls"
    - Rushing through without understanding concepts
    - Not experimenting with different parameter values
    - Ignoring visualizations and their insights
    - Skipping the theoretical background sections
