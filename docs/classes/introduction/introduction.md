# Introduction to Neural Networks

## What are Neural Networks?

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information and learn patterns from data.

## Key Concepts

### Biological Inspiration
- **Neurons**: Basic processing units
- **Synapses**: Connections between neurons
- **Learning**: Strengthening/weakening connections based on experience

### Mathematical Foundation
- **Weighted connections**: Each input has an associated weight
- **Activation functions**: Determine neuron output based on inputs
- **Learning algorithms**: Methods to adjust weights based on data

## Historical Context

### Timeline of Development
- **1943**: McCulloch-Pitts neuron model
- **1957**: Perceptron algorithm (Frank Rosenblatt)
- **1986**: Backpropagation algorithm popularized
- **2012**: Deep learning breakthrough (ImageNet)
- **2020s**: Transformer architectures and large language models

## Applications

Neural networks are used in:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Game playing (Chess, Go, etc.)
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial modeling
