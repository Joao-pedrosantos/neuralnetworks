   - Framework for testing multiple dimensions (2, 5, 10, 20, 50)
   - Comparative analysis of reconstruction quality
   - Trade-off analysis between capacity and interpretability

## How to Run

1. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   cd exercises/exercise4
   jupyter notebook vae_exercise.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run Cells Sequentially**
   - Start from the top and run each cell
   - Training takes approximately 5-10 minutes per model (CPU)
   - GPU acceleration recommended for faster training

## Key Features

### 1. Data Preparation
- Automatic MNIST download
- Normalization to [0, 1] range
- Train/validation/test split
- DataLoader with batching

### 2. VAE Architecture
- Flexible hidden layer dimensions
- Batch normalization for stability
- Dropout for regularization
- Sigmoid output activation

### 3. Reparameterization Trick
- Enables backpropagation through sampling
- z = μ + σ * ε, where ε ~ N(0,1)
- Critical for VAE training

### 4. Loss Components
- **Reconstruction Loss (BCE)**: Measures reconstruction quality
- **KL Divergence**: Regularizes latent space to N(0,1)
- **β-VAE**: Adjustable weight for KL term

### 5. Advanced Features
- Multiple latent dimensions tested
- Latent space interpolation
- Sample generation
- Comparison with standard Autoencoder
- Quantitative evaluation metrics

## Results Summary

### VAE with Latent Dim = 2
- **Pros**: Easy to visualize, interpretable
- **Cons**: Lower reconstruction quality
- **Use Case**: Exploratory analysis, teaching

### VAE with Latent Dim = 10
- **Pros**: Better reconstruction, higher capacity
- **Cons**: Harder to visualize
- **Use Case**: Production applications

### Standard Autoencoder
- **Pros**: Best reconstruction quality
- **Cons**: Irregular latent space, poor generation
- **Use Case**: Pure reconstruction tasks

## Key Insights

1. **Reparameterization Trick**: Essential for gradient flow through stochastic sampling
2. **KL Divergence**: Acts as regularizer, creates structured latent space
3. **Latent Dimensions**: Trade-off between reconstruction quality and interpretability
4. **VAE vs AE**: VAE better for generation, AE better for reconstruction
5. **Latent Space**: VAE learns continuous, smooth representations

## Challenges Addressed

1. **Loss Balancing**: Found optimal β weight for KL divergence
2. **Training Stability**: Used batch normalization and dropout
3. **Dimension Selection**: Analyzed multiple latent dimensions
4. **Visualization**: Implemented t-SNE for high-dimensional spaces
